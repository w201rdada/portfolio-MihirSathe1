### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

<<<<<<< HEAD
My hypothesis is that the use of screened devices as stimulation and within that the way they are used may be leading to an increase in the number of cases in ADHD. I plan to run analysis on two groups (one with ADHD and one without) and compare their levels of screen time as children, and then build a Machine Learning algorithm to search their Youtube accounts to see if we can predict ADHD based on Youtube use patterns. I believe that weâ€™ll find that those that clicked through more Youtube content in a short period of time will primarily be from the group with ADHD.

(ref:abs1) Hi I'm an abstract for your first big idea! I'm also a [text reference](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#text-references), which is a line of text you can reuse in several places. Use me to write a one paragraph abstract and place it in `index.Rmd` as well as under the title of `01.Rmd`. Once defined, you can reuse me simply by writing `(ref:abs1)` where you want this text to go.

### Abstract of my second cool idea {-}

(ref:abs2) I'm also an abstract! And a text reference! An abstract is all three acts of your story in a tight little package. You may or may not want to give the ending away, but if you think there's a chance an audience will read this and nothing else, you'd better convey your argument here in miniature. People are busy after all, and there's just so much good tv on the Internet these days.
