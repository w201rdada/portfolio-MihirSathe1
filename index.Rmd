### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

My hypothesis is that the use of screened devices as stimulation and within that the way they are used may be leading to an increase in the number of cases in ADHD. I plan to run analysis on two groups (one with ADHD and one without) and compare their levels of screen time as children, and then build a Machine Learning algorithm to search their Youtube accounts to see if we can predict ADHD based on Youtube use patterns. I believe that weâ€™ll find that those that clicked through more Youtube content in a short period of time will primarily be from the group with ADHD.
