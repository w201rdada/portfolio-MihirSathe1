## Parking Issues.
Bart, otherwise known as Bay Area Rapid Transit, is the transportation infrastructural backbone of the Bay Area.  Each weekday, 429,000 (citation) commuters use Bart.  Parking at some stations fill up as early as 6:30 am � 7:00 am on weekday mornings (citation).  Building additional parking can come with its own set of hurdles, such as designated land, permits, and a large initial cost.  My proposal outlines a few alternative ideas Bart can utilize to help reduce the parking shortage.  I propose that Bart should study user patterns to observe how people get to the station, where they park, and which alternative methods they use when Bart parking is full to determine feasible alternatives for commuters to get to and from their primary stations.  Our goal is to see if we can help ease the process of getting to Bart stations to make the train system more accessible for daily commuters.  


## Carpooling � a Solution.
To help gather location data, Bart can have promotions or discounts to its fares to incentivize riders to download the Bart app.  Bart can use their app�s location data to track their users� commute patterns and identify daily commuters to focus on.  Using this data, Bart can match riders with others who take similar routes to reach the station at similar times each way.  There are a couple things Bart can do with this information to reduce their issue with limited parking availability.
My first idea is for Bart to further incentivize carpooling to the station for early morning commuters.  Parking space is the scarce resource here, so anything Bart can do to maximize the number of riders using their limited space for parking will help maximize the number of riders that are able to use Bart.  I propose that Bart create a �carpool only� lot that will be open only to cars with +3 people in the mornings.  They can implement tier pricing so that the more riders come in one car, the less expensive parking will be, making it free for cars with 5 or more riders.
To prevent people from taking advantage of this discounted parking without using Bart, such as by someone working in Oakland near the station who wants to use the carpool parking deal to save money but has no intention of riding the train, Bart can charge regular parking fees to those who use their carpool lot and issue a Bart credit that expires at the end of that same day.  This way, the carpool lot will only be discounted for those riding the train.

A second idea which can run concurrently with the first is for Bart to partner with Uber to promote users ridesharing to reach the stations.  They can target riders who have short commutes but still use the parking lots, as this will capture those that will have a fairly inexpensive Uber ride.  Bart can provide incentives to daily commuters to rideshare with Uberpool via same-day Bart credit and use their data to target those who share routes from their homes to the station at the same time each day. The goal is for Uberpool to be less expensive than parking at the station so commuters will choose to use this alternative themselves.  This will free up additional parking spots for riders who live too far away for Uberpool to be an affordable alternative. 

A third idea is for Bart to have a mini-bus that functions similar to a school bus to pick up/drop off regular commuters during peak times.  The mini-bus can use the data gathered from the app to have dynamic routes, with drop off and pick up locations adjusting based on current ridership.  The bus will need to charge just under the parking cost for round-trip fare and can also ensure that ridership is only for Bart commuters by charging a higher fee for the bus and providing a discounted morning Bart commute.

The last thing Bart should do is raise prices for their single occupant vehicle parkers.  Even raising this by $2-$3 daily will incentivize people to use one of the alternatives mentioned above and will also help fund these ideas.  Bart can also publish the full cost of parking, inclusive of vehicle mileage cost which is currently rated at 74 cents/mile (citation), which should offset the cost of parking or any of the methods described above.

## Other Considerations.
If this product is implemented successfully, there is a possibility that an influx in the number of total Bart riders (cite) may come with a more seamless and convenient commute to Bart stations.   This can cause its own set of problems such as overcrowded stations and trains reaching capacity.  The frequency of trains in all lines passing through San Francisco is limited by the Transbay Tube�s capacity (citation) so running additional trains to 

An additional consideration is the cost of implementing the ideas.  A thorough cost analysis will need to be performed to evaluate the feasibility of each idea.  Raising the single-rider parking costs should however help supplement this cost.
