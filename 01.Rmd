## Rising Childhood Problems().

There are an ever growing number of children diagnosed with ADHD - the first time diagnosis of ADHD in children has risen from 2.5% in 2001 to 3.1% in 2010[@noauthor_childhood_nodate] – and through this project we hope to find out one of the potential reasons why.   Our theory surrounds the boom in technology with the advent of multiple personal devices in each home, with a wide range such as on demand streaming on Netflix or Hulu, endless available videos on Youtube.com, mobile phones always an arm’s reach away in every adult’s pocket, tablets/person computers loaded with games, and all these devices mentioned with internet capabilities.  Kids today have ever increasing access to these devices as distractions when they are bored or when their parents don’t have time to give them sufficient attention.

## Common Correlations.

My hypothesis is that the use of devices and constant stimulation for children may be leading to an increase in the number of cases of ADD and ADHD because of the short attention span developed by flipping through an endless stream of stimulation. Before the technology device boom in the 2000s, children primarily entertained themselves by reading books, playing imaginary games, or were bored without readily available stimulation and built resilience. If we can determine what levels of screen usage in early childhood are correlated with childhood disorders, we can begin to think about whether high amounts of screen time are detrimental to child development. I think that Youtube account usage would be one way to study this connection.  I would want to build a machine learning algorithm that can look at a Youtube account and compare it’s usage over the past 13 years, with the intent of identifying when an account was used by a child and when it is used by the same child as an adolescent or adult at a future time.  The idea is to measure how many videos they watch per day, average time spent on one video, and average total screen time per day both in the distant and recent past.  We can then see if there is a correlation for those who watched more hours a day as a child to see if they also flip through more videos per hour as a teenager.  Youtube began in 2005, so someone who was 6 back then would be 19 now, fitting the desired age difference.

## Other Considerations.

Even if there is a correlation, we have to consider that it is also possible that the increased number of cases of ADD and ADHD may be caused by better diagnosis in medicine over time compared to 2005.  As medicine continues to improve their ability to diagnose ADD and ADHD appropriately, more cases of each will naturally occur over time whether or not there is a change in the general population.
