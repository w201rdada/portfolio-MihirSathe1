## Rising Childhood Problems().

There are an ever growing number of children diagnosed with ADHD in the United States.  The first-time diagnosis of ADHD in children has risen from 2.5% in 2001 to 3.1% in 2010[@noauthor_childhood_nodate] – and through this project we hope to find out one of the potential reasons why.   Our theory surrounds the boom in accessibility to technology with screens ranging from on demand streaming on Netflix or Hulu, endless available videos on Youtube.com.  In US households from 2011 to 2017, smartphone ownership has risen from 52% to 98%; tablet ownership from 8% to 78% with 42% of children in 2017 owning tablets themselves, up from under 1% in 2011[@noauthor_common_nodate].  Children additionally have more access to personal computers, gaming consoles, and on demand streaming such as Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube.  Combining the devices in each household, a child can have access to high speed internet, hundreds to games, and multiple options for entertainment on demand.  Kids today have ever increasing access to these devices as distractions when they are bored or when their parents don’t have time to give them sufficient attention.   I plan to run analysis on two groups, one with ADHD and one without, and compare their levels of screen time as children, and then build a Machine Learning algorithm to search their Youtube accounts to see if we can predict ADHD based on Youtube usage.

## Common Correlations.

My hypothesis is that the use of devices and constant stimulation for children may be leading to an increase in the number of cases of ADHD because of the short attention span developed by flipping through an endless stream of stimulation. Before the technology device boom in the 2000s, children primarily entertained themselves by reading books, entertaining themselves with their imaginations, playing outside, or were bored without readily available stimulation which built resilience[@goldhill_psychologists_nodate]. 
If we can determine the levels of screen usage in early childhood that correlate with ADHD, we can begin to think about whether high amounts of screen time are detrimental to child development. 
I propose to begin our study by designing an experiment with 2 groups of teenagers aged 15-18; one group containing people who have been diagnosed with ADHD and another control group without ADHD.  We will survey these two groups as well as their parents to gather screen usage rates across multiple devices and will tabulate their usage to give us one metric to compare participants (streaming service, video game, tv, etc).  We can then analyze the data to determine the correlation between screen usage and ADHD.

As an additional part of this study, we will ask for access to their Youtube accounts.  Youtube began in 2005 so we will have approximately 13 years of data in total.  I plan to build a machine learning that will use our participant’s Youtube usage the past 13 years and use a measure to teach the program to decide whether a user has ADHD or not by running the metrics of hours watched per year and total number of videos watched per hour against each group in our initial study (one that has ADHD and one that does not).  My second hypothesis is that those with ADHD will have watched a similar total amount of content as those without it, but will have clicked through more videos per hour than the control group.
Finally, we can see if there is a correlation for those who clicked through more videos per hour over their years of Youtube history and those with diagnosed ADHD.

## Other Considerations.

Even if there is a correlation between ADHD and screen usage, we have to consider that as medicine has improved their ability to diagnose ADHD appropriately since 2001, more cases will naturally occur over time whether or not there is a change in actual ADHD per capita.  We will try and adjust for this diagnostic improvement in our analysis.  

Finding a correlation between Youtube clicks and ADHD could make Youtube rethink their usage policies for children – perhaps children will be restricted to a certain number of videos per hour or will be flagged when they go over a certain amount and their parents notified.  If successful our machine learning algorithm can also be used by Youtube and the general population to search and flag children who may develop ADHD.
