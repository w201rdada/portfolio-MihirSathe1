I’m also a text reference, which is a line of text you can reuse in several places. Use me to write a one paragraph abstract and place it in index.Rmd as well as under the title of 01.Rmd. Once defined, you can reuse me simply by writing (ref:abs1) where you want this text to go. Abstract of my second cool idea I’m also an abstract! And a text reference! An abstract is all three acts of your story in a tight little package. You may or may not want to give the ending away, but if you think there’s a chance an audience will read this and nothing else, you’d better convey your argument here in miniature. People are busy after all, and there’s just so much good tv on the Internet these days. About the author Mihir works at Deloitte Consulting in San Jose and is currently in his first term in the MIDS program. Mihir is an avid Golden State Warriors fan, enjoys hiking and camping, and is excited to learn more about the data science world. Updated: 2018-03-10 "],
["Screens-Children.html", "1 Unseen Effects of Technology 1.1 Rising Childhood Problems. 1.2 Common Correlations. 1.3 Other Considerations.", " 1 Unseen Effects of Technology Keywords ADHD, Childhood, Youtube 1.1 Rising Childhood Problems. There have been an ever growing number of children diagnosed with ADHD in the United States over the past 2 decades. The first-time diagnosis of ADHD in children rose from 2.5% in 2001 to 3.1% in 2010(Childhood Diagnosis of ADHD Increased Dramatically over 9-Year Period 2018), and through this project we hope to find out one of the potential reasons why. In US households, from 2011 to 2017 smartphone ownership rose from 52% to 98% and tablet ownership from 8% to 78% with 42% of children in 2017 owning tablets themselves, up from under 1% in 2011(“The Common Sense Census: Media Use by Kids Age Zero to Eight 2017 Common Sense Media” 2018). Children have more access to personal computers, gaming consoles, and on demand streaming such as Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube. Combining devices in each household, a child can have access to high speed internet, hundreds to games, and multiple options for entertainment on demand as a distraction when they are bored or when their parents do not have time to give them sufficient attention. 1.2 Common Correlations. Before the technology device boom in the 2000s, children primarily entertained themselves by reading books, using their imaginations, playing outside, or were bored without readily available stimulation which built resilience(Goldhill and Goldhill 2018). My hypothesis is that the use of screened devices as stimulation and within that the way they are used may be leading to an increase in the number of cases in ADHD. I plan to run analysis on two groups (one with ADHD and one without) and compare their levels of screen time as children, and then build a Machine Learning algorithm to search their Youtube accounts to see if we can predict ADHD based on Youtube use patterns. I believe that we’ll find that those that clicked through more Youtube content in a short period of time will primarily be from the group with ADHD. I propose to run this study by designing an experiment with 2 groups of teenagers (one with ADHD and a control group without) aged 15-18 so that we can view Youtube history from as early as when the participants were 2-5 years old as well as have a full history of their screen usage since they were toddlers. We will survey these two groups as well as their parents to gather screen usage rates across multiple devices and will tabulate their usage to give us one metric to compare participants. This metric will add time spent across all devices such as streaming services, video games, television, etc. We can then perform analysis to determine the correlation between screen usage and ADHD. As an additional part of this study, we will ask for access to each participant’s Youtube account. Youtube began in 2005 so we will have approximately 13 years of data in total. I plan to build a Machine Learning program that will use our participant’s Youtube usage the past 13 years and use a method to teach the program to decide whether a user has ADHD or not by running the metrics of hours watched per year and total number of videos watched per hour against each group in our study. I think that the participants who clicked through more videos per hour will be from the group with ADHD. If we can determine the levels of screen usage and patterns of use in early childhood that correlate with ADHD, we can begin to think about whether high amounts of screen time are detrimental to child development, as well as whether we should restrict how children entertain themselves with screened devices. Figure 1.1: xkcd: Machine Learning 1.3 Other Considerations. If we find a correlation between ADHD and screen usage, we have to consider that as medicine has improved its ability to diagnose ADHD appropriately since 2001, more cases will naturally occur over time whether or not there is a change in actual ADHD rates per capita. We will try and adjust for this medical diagnostic improvement in our analysis. Finding a correlation between Youtube clicks and ADHD could make Youtube rethink their usage policies for children – perhaps children will be restricted to a certain number of videos per hour or will be flagged when they go over a certain amount and their parents notified. There will likely be follow-up studies researching usage of other devices and entertainment to see if they present the same problem that Youtube did for the participants in this study. If successful, my Machine Learning program can also be used by Youtube and the general population to search and flag children who may develop ADHD. Bibliography "],
["BARTparking.html", "2 BART Parking 2.1 Parking Issues. 2.2 Carpooling – a Solution. 2.3 Making the System Function", " 2 BART Parking Keywords BART, Public Transit, Commuting, Parking 2.1 Parking Issues. Bart, otherwise known as Bay Area Rapid Transit, is the transportation infrastructural backbone of the Bay Area, with 429,000 (“BARTfactsheet,” n.d.) commuters each weekday. A major issue riders have to deal with is a shortage of parking, which can fill up as early as 6:30 am – 7:00 am on weekday mornings (“BART’s Full Parking Lots Top Mr. Roadshow’s ‘Dirty Dozen’ List – East Bay Times” 2018). Building additional parking comes with its own set of hurdles, such as designated land, permits, and a large sunk cost. My proposal outlines a few alternative ideas Bart can utilize to address its parking shortage. Bart can start by studying user patterns to observe how people get to the station, where they park, and which alternative methods they use when Bart parking is full to determine feasible alternatives for commuters to get to and from their primary stations. The goal of this proposal is to see if it is possible to make the Bart system more accessible for daily commuters by addressing the lack of available weekday parking spaces at Bart stations. 2.2 Carpooling – a Solution. To help gather location data, Bart will need its riders to download their app so Bart can pull and track user’s location data to map out commute patterns and identify groups of daily commuters to effectively focus on. Bart will try to generate a large app user base to have as much data as possible to analyze, and can incentive people to download the app through small incentives such as Bart credit via clipper card. If there is not system wide adoption of their app, they will focus on users who have downloaded the app and publish the benefits of the app outlined below which will further incentivize people to download their app. As they gather and analyze their user’s location data, Bart can match riders with others who take similar routes to and from the station at similar times. I’ve outlined three ideas Bart can implement using this data. My first idea is for Bart to further incentivize carpooling to the station for morning commuters. Parking space is the scarce resource here, so anything Bart can do to optimize the number of riders using their limited parking space will help maximize the number of riders that are able to use Bart. I propose that Bart create a “carpool only” lot that will be open only to cars with +3 people in the mornings. They can implement tier pricing so that the more riders come in one car, the less expensive parking will be, making it free for cars with 5 or more riders. To prevent people from taking advantage of this discounted parking without using Bart, such as by a person working in Oakland near the station who wants to use the carpool parking deal to save money but has no intention of riding the train, Bart can charge regular parking fees to those who use their carpool lot and issue a Bart credit that expires at the end of that same day. This way, the carpool lot will only be discounted for those riding the train. The entry to the carpool lot will be monitored by an agent, and the credits will be delivered by swiping the clipper cards of all carpoolers in the vehicle at the lot entrance. A second idea which can run concurrently with the first is for Bart to partner with Uber to promote users ridesharing to reach the stations. The easiest way to achieve this is to make Uberpools for commutes to/from Bart stations payable via Clipper card. Uber will be incentivized to pair with Bart since it will increase people’s dependence on Uber as a mode of transportation and help build their brand. Bart can target riders who have short commutes but still use the parking lots, as this will capture those that will have a fairly inexpensive Uber ride. Bart can provide financial incentives to daily commuters to rideshare by integrating Clipper as a form of payment for Uberpools and delivering credits on users Bart rides that expire a few hours after completing an Uberpool ride. The goal is for Uberpool to be less expensive than parking at the station so commuters will choose to use this alternative naturally. This will free up parking spots for riders who live further from stations since Uberpool won’t be an affordable option for them. A third idea is for Bart to have a mini-bus that uses Microtransit routing to pick up/drop off regular commuters during peak times (“MicroTransit Pilot Project” 2018). The mini-bus will use the data gathered from the app to have dynamic routes, with drop off and pick up locations adjusting based on current ridership. The bus will need to charge just under the parking cost for round-trip fare and can also ensure that ridership is only for Bart commuters by charging for the bus on Clipper and providing a discounted morning Bart commute. Our goal is to see if we can help ease the process of getting to Bart stations to make the train system more accessible for daily commuters. After gathering data, we can additionally provide incentives for uberpool for certain riders based on where they are coming and what time they commute, to free up parking spots. To help gather location data, Bart can have promotions or discounts to download the Bart app. 2.3 Making the System Function The last thing Bart should do is raise prices for their single occupant vehicle parkers by $2-$3, since increased parking costs will incentivize drivers to try and use one of the alternatives mentioned above and will also help fund these ideas. This is reasonable to expect from the riders since they will now have 3 alternatives to reach the station (carpool, Uberpool, Bart mini-bus). Bart can also publish the full cost of parking, inclusive of vehicle mileage cost which is currently rated at 74 cents/mile (“AAA Says It Costs About 74 Cents Per Mile to Drive” 2017) which will further help push some drivers to not drive themselves to the station. Bart will initially have to invest into this program, giving discounts to incentivize riders to download Bart’s app, rebuilding parts of the parking structure to accommodate a larger carpool lot, and purchasing the mini-buses, and will additionally need to subsidize carpoolers through discounted parking rates, Uberpool, and their mini-bus operation cost while ridership climbs to a critical mass volume. The increased cost of parking and boost in Bart ridership due to greater accessibility will increase overall revenue and fund my proposed ideas. Bibliography "],
