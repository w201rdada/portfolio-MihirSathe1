There have been an ever growing number of children diagnosed with ADHD in the United States over the past 2 decades. The first-time diagnosis of ADHD in children rose from 2.5% in 2001 to 3.1% in 2010(“Childhood Diagnosis of ADHD Increased Dramatically over 9-Year Period” 2018), and through this project we hope to find out one of the potential reasons why. In US households, from 2011 to 2017 smartphone ownership rose from 52% to 98% and tablet ownership from 8% to 78% with 42% of children in 2017 owning tablets themselves, up from under 1% in 2011(???). Children have more access to personal computers, gaming consoles, and on demand streaming such as Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube. Combining devices in each household, a child can have access to high speed internet, hundreds to games, and multiple options for entertainment on demand as a distraction when they are bored or when their parents do not have time to give them sufficient attention. 1.2 Common Correlations. Before the technology device boom in the 2000s, children primarily entertained themselves by reading books, using their imaginations, playing outside, or were bored without readily available stimulation which built resilience(???). My hypothesis is that the use of screened devices as stimulation and within that the way they are used may be leading to an increase in the number of cases in ADHD. I plan to run analysis on two groups (one with ADHD and one without) and compare their levels of screen time as children, and then build a Machine Learning algorithm to search their Youtube accounts to see if we can predict ADHD based on Youtube use patterns. I believe that we’ll find that those that clicked through more Youtube content in a short period of time will primarily be from the group with ADHD. I propose to run this study by designing an experiment with 2 groups of teenagers (one with ADHD and a control group without) aged 15-18 so that we can view Youtube history from as early as when the participants were 2-5 years old as well as have a full history of their screen usage since they were toddlers. We will survey these two groups as well as their parents to gather screen usage rates across multiple devices and will tabulate their usage to give us one metric to compare participants. This metric will add time spent across all devices such as streaming services, video games, television, etc. We can then perform analysis to determine the correlation between screen usage and ADHD. As an additional part of this study, we will ask for access to each participant’s Youtube account. Youtube began in 2005 so we will have approximately 13 years of data in total. I plan to build a Machine Learning program that will use our participant’s Youtube usage the past 13 years and use a method to teach the program to decide whether a user has ADHD or not by running the metrics of hours watched per year and total number of videos watched per hour against each group in our study. I think that the participants who clicked through more videos per hour will be from the group with ADHD. If we can determine the levels of screen usage and patterns of use in early childhood that correlate with ADHD, we can begin to think about whether high amounts of screen time are detrimental to child development, as well as whether we should restrict how children entertain themselves with screened devices. Figure 1.1: xkcd: Machine Learning 1.3 Other Considerations. If we find a correlation between ADHD and screen usage, we have to consider that as medicine has improved its ability to diagnose ADHD appropriately since 2001, more cases will naturally occur over time whether or not there is a change in actual ADHD rates per capita. We will try and adjust for this medical diagnostic improvement in our analysis. Finding a correlation between Youtube clicks and ADHD could make Youtube rethink their usage policies for children – perhaps children will be restricted to a certain number of videos per hour or will be flagged when they go over a certain amount and their parents notified. There will likely be follow-up studies researching usage of other devices and entertainment to see if they present the same problem that Youtube did for the participants in this study. If successful, my Machine Learning program can also be used by Youtube and the general population to search and flag children who may develop ADHD. Bibliography "],
